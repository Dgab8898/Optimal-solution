The applications of differential calculas
Differential calculus can be used to analyse and applied to to complex problems in our society. Calculus has made and will continue to make significant contributions to every field of human endeavour that uses quantitative measurement to further its aims. 
In this task we will examine optimisation problems, where a quantity is to be maximised or minimised. These problems arise both outside and within mathematics, for example in the construction of water line through different region.

## Library
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
from scipy import optimize

## Define the objective function that wll minimw3:




### Next create a grid of values that we can plot our objective function




## Now we can evaluate the function on this grid of points:


## Next we create  a new figure with 3d axes object and set the a title



## Now we can plot the objective function as a surface on the axes we just created:



## We chooose an initial point that our minimix=zation routine will start its iteration at and plot this on the surface:
